    puts 'Many blackjack tables use multiple decks to thwart this method of card counting.'
    puts 'If there are multiple decks, you must make a small adjustment to the running count to calculate the true count.'
    puts 'The true count is the running count divided by the number of decks remaining.'
    puts 'If there is just one deck, the running count is equal to the true count.'
    puts 'From there, if the true count remains in the positive, the dealer of the house has a greater chance of busting. If the true count is negative, the house has the advantage.'

  How do you beat the dealer?
  #By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealerâ€™s hand value
  #By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
  #By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

  How do you lose to the dealer?
  #Your hand value exceeds 21.
  #The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round
