# cli-portfolio-project

A CLI for learning how to count cards and excel at Blackjack.

Set the ambiance and jump into a game of Blackjack! Try to beat the house and keep your running count in order as two computer players do the same. Practice with 1-8 decks of cards to get used to the different pace of the game.
